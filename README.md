This repository demonstrates a subtle error related to DOM manipulation in HTML. The `bug.html` file shows code that attempts to modify an element's content before that element exists in the Document Object Model (DOM). This commonly leads to a JavaScript error.  The `bugSolution.html` shows a corrected version that uses `setTimeout` to ensure the element is available before modification. This is an uncommon error that can be tricky to debug. The solution highlights the importance of timing and asynchronous operations when working with the DOM.
